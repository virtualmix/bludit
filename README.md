Bludit v4
---------------
I'm working on Bludit v4 but I don't have an ETA for the first alpha or beta version. You can follow the changes in the new branch `v4.0` and in the blog post [Bludit v4 Road map](https://blog.bludit.com/bludit-4-road-map).

I'm doing a big refactor of Bludit's core so please be patient and let me release an Alpha version before push changes to the branch `v4.0`.

Feedback and ideas are welcome, you can create an `issue` with the request; Please provide some examples of the idea in the `issue`.
